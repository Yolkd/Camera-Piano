Credit: We used OpenCV, CVZone, Mediapipe, Python, Pygame, Mido, Numpy, as well as tutorials from Murtaza's workshop.
Used Claude to learn Mido and export the .mid files.

This software is generally meant for composers on the go (or in a dorm without a piano) to be able to compose music more naturally than just through standard software. With the use of computer vision, we simulate a piano that allows a person to play and in the end creates a MIDI file for their own use.
Truly the most contemporary music can be made with this software.
One can become, shall we say, the modern Mozart with such fine composing software.
