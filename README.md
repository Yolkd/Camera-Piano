Credit: We used OpenCV, CVZone, Mediapipe, Python, Musicpy, Midiutil, Numpy, as well as tutorials from Murtaza's workshop.

This software is generally meant for composers on the go (or in a dorm without a piano) to be able to compose music more naturally than just through standard software. With the use of computer vision, we simulate a piano that allows a person to play and in the end creates a MIDI file for their own use.
